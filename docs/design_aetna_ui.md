# Aetna UI Pivot

We moved the chat UI off egui onto
[aetna](https://github.com/computer-whisperer/aetna), a small declarative GPU
UI library shaped around how an LLM authors UI. This doc tracks the why, the
crate layout, the architectural choices that fall out of aetna's `App` model,
and where each stage of the port landed.

**Current entry points:**
- Browser: served by the agent itself at `http://$LISTEN_SERVER/` (wasm bundle baked into the release binary; build via `wasm-pack build crates/whisper-agent-aetna-ui --target web`).
- Native: `cargo build -p whisper-agent-desktop-aetna && ./target/.../whisper-agent-desktop-aetna --server http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Dev all-in-one: `./scripts/dev.sh` (server + daemons; browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`) or `./scripts/dev_aetna.sh` (adds the native client on top).
- Bundle dump: `cargo run -p whisper-agent-aetna-ui --example dump_bundles`

The old egui stack (`whisper-agent-webui`, `whisper-agent-desktop`) has been
removed; aetna is now the only browser + native UI implementation.

## Why aetna

The thesis is the load-bearing argument: aetna is shaped around how a *model*
authors UI, not how a human web developer does. For a project where the
loop driving the codebase is itself an LLM, that fit dominates other
trade-offs:

- **Vocabulary parity with shadcn / Radix / Tailwind.** Stock widgets
  (`sidebar`, `sidebar_menu_button`, `card_header`, `alert`, `badge`, `dialog`,
  `popover`, `tabs_list`, `text_area`, …) match the shapes the model has the
  most training-time exposure to. The same prompt that produced reasonable
  egui code produces *better* aetna code.
- **Build/on_event split is enforced.** `App::build(&self, &BuildCx) -> El`
  takes `&self`; mutations only happen in `on_event(&mut self, UiEvent)`.
  The egui webui interleaves reads and mutations freely inside
  `App::ui(&mut self, ui)` — an architectural pattern that becomes a
  refactor liability as the surface area grows. Aetna structurally prevents
  it.
- **Bundle artifacts as the agent-loop feedback channel.** A single CPU-only
  call produces SVG + tree dump + draw_op IR + lint findings + shader
  manifest per scene, with no GPU device required. The model can verify
  layout intent end-to-end without waiting for a window to come up.
- **One implementation across native + browser.** `aetna-winit-wgpu` for
  desktop, `aetna-web` (wasm + WebGPU) for the browser. Single `App` impl
  paints both, which makes the server's embedded webui bundle a
  build-time choice, not a code choice.

## Crate layout

```
crates/
  whisper-agent-aetna-ui/         ← platform-agnostic ChatApp (cdylib + rlib)
    src/
      lib.rs                        re-exports + wasm entry registration
      app.rs                        ChatApp impl of aetna_core::App
      web_entry.rs                  wasm browser entry (winit + wgpu host)
    assets/                         index.html / login.html / favicons
                                    (rust-embed source for the server)
    pkg/                            wasm-pack output (gitignored)
    examples/
      dump_bundles.rs               scene-driven bundle export
    out/                            bundle artifacts (gitignored)

  whisper-agent-desktop-aetna/    ← native binary on aetna-winit-wgpu
    src/main.rs                     winit host + tokio + tungstenite bridge
```

The aetna-ui crate replaces the deleted `whisper-agent-webui`
(browser, egui) and `whisper-agent-desktop` (native, egui) crates —
same workspace shape, single ui implementation across both targets.
`aetna-core` and `aetna-winit-wgpu` come in via path-deps to a
sibling worktree.

### Aetna as a path-dep

Aetna is under active development; we track upstream `HEAD` rather than a
crates.io release. Path-dep reaches up out of the workspace:

```toml
# crates/whisper-agent-aetna-ui/Cargo.toml
aetna-core = { path = "../../../../aetna/aetna.main/crates/aetna-core" }
```

The four `..`s reflect the user's worktree convention:
`~/workspace/{aetna,whisper-agent}/{aetna,whisper}.main/`. When aetna
stabilizes and ships to crates.io, this becomes a versioned dep + the path
gets dropped (or kept behind a `[patch]` for development).

## Architecture

### The `App` contract

```rust
impl aetna_core::App for ChatApp {
    fn before_build(&mut self) { /* drain inbound queue, mutate state */ }
    fn build(&self, _cx: &BuildCx) -> El { /* read state, return tree */ }
    fn on_event(&mut self, event: UiEvent) { /* route by key, mutate */ }
    fn selection(&self) -> Selection { self.selection.clone() }
    fn theme(&self) -> Theme { Theme::aetna_dark() }
}
```

The runtime calls these in this order per frame:

1. `before_build(&mut self)` — drain the inbound `WS event` queue, fold
   server frames into `ChatApp` state.
2. `build(&self, cx)` — pure projection of state into an `El` tree.
3. (host paints; pumps OS events)
4. `on_event(&mut self, event)` — for each routed click / activate / text
   input / hotkey, mutate state and optionally call `(self.send_fn)(...)`
   to send a wire frame back to the server.

This split is *the* load-bearing constraint of the port. Every interactive
element gets a `.key("...")` that names a route; every action is an
`event.is_click_or_activate("...")` arm in `on_event`. We never reach for
mutable state during build.

### Routing key conventions

Two-tier scheme:
- **Static keys** for singletons: `compose`, `send`. Declared as `const &str`.
- **Templated keys** for collection items: `thread:{id}`, future
  `pod:{id}`, `behavior:{pod_id}/{behavior_id}`. Parsed in `on_event` with
  `key.strip_prefix("thread:")` and friends.

Compose-target keys (`compose`, `send`) are deliberately short — there's
exactly one compose box at a time. The new-thread form (Stage 4) reuses
both keys; the same `send_compose` routes between `SendUserMessage` and
`CreateThread` based on `selected.is_some()`. The picker triggers use
`picker:{backend|model|pod}` with `select_menu` option keys carrying the
canonical `:option:{value}` suffix.

### Transport bridge

The native binary owns a tokio runtime for the WebSocket client; the UI runs
on the main thread inside winit's event loop. Two bridges connect them:

```
WS task ──► tokio mpsc ──► bouncer task ──► Mutex<Vec<InboundEvent>> staging
                                                       │
                                       drained by App::before_build
                                                       ▼
                                       Rc<RefCell<VecDeque<InboundEvent>>>
                                                       │
                                                drained per-frame
                                                       ▼
                                                  ChatApp state
```

The `Mutex<Vec>` step exists because the UI thread can't poll a
`tokio::sync::mpsc::Receiver` directly without a tokio context. The
`Rc<RefCell<VecDeque>>` is the same shape the egui webui exposes, so the
host shells (native + future wasm) hand the same `Inbound` / `SendFn`
pair to either UI crate.

Outbound is a `Box<dyn Fn(ClientToServer)>` closure — the UI calls
`(self.send_fn)(msg)`, the closure encodes CBOR + pushes onto a tokio
mpsc that the WS task drains.

### Wakeup caveat

Aetna's `aetna-winit-wgpu` host doesn't currently expose a cross-thread
"wake the event loop" primitive (no `EventLoopProxy` re-export). To keep
WS frames visible within ~one frame after they arrive, the desktop binary
runs with `HostConfig::with_redraw_interval(Duration::from_millis(33))`
(~30 Hz). Costs idle CPU; eventually we want to either:

- upstream a wakeup channel in `aetna-winit-wgpu`, or
- hold the `winit::EventLoopProxy` on the bouncer side ourselves and
  `proxy.send_event(())` on each frame.

Flagged as a stage-1 scaffold concern; not a blocker.

### Bundle export

`examples/dump_bundles.rs` produces a five-file bundle per scene:

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `<scene>.svg` | layout-accurate visual fallback |
| `<scene>.tree.txt` | semantic walk: computed rects, roles, source paths |
| `<scene>.draw_ops.txt` | the same draw-op IR the GPU runner consumes |
| `<scene>.shader_manifest.txt` | shaders the tree references + uniforms |
| `<scene>.lint.txt` | findings (raw colors, duplicate ids, overflow) |

Scenes are seeded by pushing synthetic `InboundEvent`s into the `Inbound`
queue and dispatching `UiEvent::synthetic_click` for selection — same
paths the live binary uses, so the dump reflects real state mutations
through the routing layer. Adding a new scene is a one-arm change to the
`Scene` enum + a `seed` arm in `build_app`.

The `Scene` enum is the extension point as more state becomes worth
dumping (sidebar empty / populated, chat log streaming, modal open,
behavior editor active, …).

## Visual idioms — "tailwind/shadcn for free"

Successive refactors moved the UI off hand-rolled chrome onto aetna's
purpose-built widgets. The rules of thumb:

- **Sidebar.** `sidebar([...])` for the surface, `sidebar_header([...])`
  for the title row. The active *workspace* is selected via a `tabs_list`
  pod-tab strip at the top — single active pod at a time, so the rest of
  the sidebar can spend its vertical real estate on that pod's threads
  (and eventually behaviors, dispatch nesting, filters) instead of
  competing collapsible sections. Threads render as
  `item_group([item([item_content([item_title, item_description])])])`
  rows — aetna's "object/action list row" widget gets us the right
  hover/press/focus rail + cursor + keying for free. Title sits above a
  muted second line of `state · relative_time`. Dispatch children are
  left-padded by `SPACE_3 * depth` so chains read top-down without
  inline marker glyphs on every row. Selected row uses `.current()`
  (ACCENT fill — quieter than `.primary()`).
- **Toolbar headers, not card headers, for thread identity.**
  `toolbar([toolbar_title, spacer, state_badge])` is the thread-pane
  header recipe. Cards isolate objects; the chat content frame is one
  continuous record with a header bar above it.
- **Event-log rows for the chat log, not cards per message.** Per
  upstream aetna guidance (`aetna-core/README.md` "Conversation /
  event-log row"), each message renders as a 3px role-colored gutter
  beside the message content — `row([gutter, content])`. User rows
  optionally take a faint info-tinted fill so they pop out of a long
  assistant stream. Local helper `log_row(role_color, faint_fill,
  content)` in `app.rs`.
- **Markdown for assistant text.** Assistant content goes through
  `aetna_markdown::md(text)`, which walks pulldown-cmark's event API
  into `paragraph` / `bullet_list` / `code_block` / `inlines` /
  `text(...).code()` etc. — same surface a hand-authored aetna tree
  would use. User text stays as `paragraph(text)` (we don't render
  user-typed markdown).
- **Accordion for noisy rows.** Reasoning and tool-call rows nest
  `accordion_item(group, value, label, open, [body])`. Open state
  lives on `ChatApp.open_accordions: HashSet<String>` keyed by
  `accordion_item_key(group, value)`, toggled in `on_event` by
  matching `:accordion:` in the routed key.
- **Alerts.** Connection failures surface as `alert([alert_title,
  alert_description]).warning() / .destructive()` at the top of the
  content pane. Status-tier UX, separate from the per-thread chrome.
- **Badges.** Connection chip in the sidebar header and the per-thread
  state pill (idle / working / done / failed / cancelled) are plain
  `badge(text)` with `.success() / .muted() / .warning() / .destructive()`
  variants.
- **Layout.** Always reach for `tokens::SPACE_*` for gaps and padding,
  `tokens::SIDEBAR_WIDTH` for the sidebar size, `Size::Fill(1.0)` /
  `Size::Hug` / `Size::Fixed` for sizing. No raw px literals in chrome.

When the helpers don't fit a shape (collapsible section in the sidebar,
nested sub-groups, custom row anatomy), wrap a custom composition *inside*
the helper rather than replacing it — keeps the canonical surface recipe
correct without forcing data into the helper mold. Per aetna's
`widget_kit.md`.

## Stages

Each stage is a self-contained slice with its own commit. The progression is
roughly the inverse of dependency depth: read-only shell first, then
write paths, then composition, then cross-cutting features.

### Sidebar redesign (in flight)

The egui sidebar's pod-as-collapsible-section idiom doesn't scale when
one pod dominates and others are sparse — a real-world snapshot of the
production server has 2 pods (4 threads vs. 29 threads + 4 cron
behaviors). The aetna sidebar is being redesigned around an active-pod
tab strip rather than ported piecemeal. Multi-slice rollout:

- **✅ Slice α — pod tabs + item-row threads.** `tabs_list` selector at
  the top of the sidebar; `item_group` of `item([item_content([title,
  description])])` rows for the active pod's threads. State and
  relative-activity in the muted second line. Dispatch children
  left-padded by `SPACE_3 * depth`. "Show N more" pagination at
  `SIDEBAR_THREAD_PREVIEW = 10` rows. No new wire calls.
- **✅ Slice β — behaviors first-class.** Per-pod `Behaviors (N)`
  subsection *below* the threads section, populated via
  `ListBehaviors` (deduped per pod per connection) and kept fresh
  by `BehaviorList` / `BehaviorCreated` / `BehaviorUpdated` /
  `BehaviorDeleted` / `BehaviorStateChanged`. Each row is an
  item-shaped expandable container: title is the display name
  (`⚠`-prefixed when load_error), description is `"{kind} ·
  {status}"` for healthy rows (`status` = `paused` /
  `last fired Nh` / `no runs yet`) or `"errored: {reason}"` for
  malformed configs, plus a `"{N} runs"` caption when the row has
  spawned threads in view, plus a chevron in the actions slot.
  Click toggles `expanded_behaviors` membership; when expanded,
  the behavior's spawned threads (`origin.behavior_id == this`)
  render nested below with `depth=1` indent. The threads section
  filters its rows to interactive (no origin) plus orphan-origin
  (origin set but behavior not in registry) — orphans get a
  `· via {behavior}` description suffix so deleted-behavior
  provenance stays visible.

  **β.2** added inline action toolbars in the expanded body: a
  Run-now button (`RunBehavior`, disabled on errored rows since
  the scheduler would just bounce) and a Pause/Resume toggle
  (`SetBehaviorEnabled`). Wire echoes (`ThreadCreated` for runs,
  `BehaviorStateChanged` for the toggle) update the local view
  on the next tick — no optimistic mutation, so the UI never
  diverges from server state.

  Edit / Delete still pending γ (need modals + arm-confirm). Cron
  schedule humanization also γ since `BehaviorSummary` doesn't
  carry the schedule string and needs a `GetBehavior` round-trip.
- **✅ Slice γ — danger affordances.** Two-click arm-confirm
  landed for Delete Behavior. State is a single
  `delete_armed_behavior: Option<(pod, behavior)>` slot — only one
  arm at a time so the UI never has two "confirm" buttons live.
  Pre-handler at the top of `on_event` auto-disarms when the next
  click lands anywhere other than the matching `behavior-delete:`
  key, so opening a modal / switching tabs / picking a thread all
  cancel a pending arm.

  Visual contract: idle Delete is a trash `icon_button().ghost()`;
  armed is the same trash icon under `.destructive()` (solid red
  fill — `.ghost().destructive()` doesn't compose, since
  `destructive()` writes back to `fill` regardless of ghost).
  The ghost→destructive color flip is the arm signal: a quiet
  gray icon goes loud red on the user's first click, with time
  to render before the second click of a normal-tempo double-tap
  lands. Pre-handler at the top of `on_event` clears the arm if
  any other click happens first. Layout: single row of four
  icon-buttons (Run / Pause·Resume / Edit / Delete) clustered
  side-by-side. With every action shrunk to 32 px the strip is
  ~152 px wide, well under the sidebar's 224 px, so the two-row
  split the text-labelled version needed is gone.

  Chrome leans on icons over text per `feedback_aetna_chrome_icons`
  — Run is `zap` (lightning, distinct from Pause's `play`-on-
  resume), Pause is `pause`/`play`, Edit is `square-pen`, Delete
  is `trash`. None of these ship in aetna's built-in
  [`IconName`] registry yet; the lucide-shaped SVGs are bundled
  in `crates/whisper-agent-aetna-ui/src/icons.rs` and constructed
  via `SvgIcon::parse_current_color`. When a future aetna
  upstream registers them, the bundled `LazyLock<SvgIcon>` slots
  collapse to plain `"name"` strings.

  Edit landed via the per-behavior editor sheet (see Stage 8).
  Archive-pod and other danger ops will reuse the same
  arm-confirm shape when they land. (Sidebar parity check: the
  egui sibling rendered `name [{kind}]` where kind is the
  discriminator string — `manual` / `cron` / `webhook`. The
  aetna sidebar's `{kind} · {status}` description already
  matches that. Humanizing the actual cron expression in this
  row was a "would be nice" idea, not a port gap.)
- **✅ Slice δ — entry points.** Three "+" affordances landed,
  each scoped to where it appears:
    - **Per-pod "new thread"** — `icon_button("plus")` keyed
      `sidebar:new-thread` in the Threads section header. Click
      clears `selected` and pre-binds the active pod into
      `picker_pod` so the new-thread compose pane opens scoped
      to where the user clicked. No wire round-trip until Start.
    - **Global "new pod"** — `icon_button("plus")` keyed
      `sidebar:new-pod` in the sidebar header next to the
      connection badge. Opens the `+ New pod` dialog (Stage 8
      modal scaffold). The title `.ellipsis()`s when the badge
      grows ("connecting…") so the chrome stays one row.
    - **Per-pod "new behavior"** — `icon_button("plus")` keyed
      `sidebar:new-behavior:{pod}` in the Behaviors section
      header (suffix carries the pod id so the dialog scopes
      correctly even if the active tab changes between click
      and modal mount). Opens the `+ New behavior` dialog.

  The Behaviors section now renders an empty-state message
  ("no behaviors in this pod yet") + the "+" affordance once
  the per-pod `BehaviorList` round-trip lands — the affordance
  is most needed precisely when the pod is empty. Pre-list
  pods skip the section entirely so a "just connected"
  sidebar doesn't flash an empty section.

### ✅ Stage 1 — Scaffold (commit `a46b421`)

Two crates wired up; native binary opens; connection-status banner only.
Dev script + bundle dump infrastructure in place. No chat content.

### ✅ Stage 2 — Sidebar + read-only chat log (same commit, then `3db5938`)

Sidebar with pods + threads, click-to-select with `nav-thread:{id}`
routing. Snapshot rendering of `display_items` (text only, no markdown).
Validates the build/on_event split end-to-end.

Polish refactor swapped hand-rolled column/row chrome for `sidebar` /
`card` / `alert` / `badge` primitives.

Chat-log polish (commits `fb6d675` / `55269bb`):
- thread-prefix `Role::System` and `Role::Tools` messages render as
  default-collapsed `SetupPrompt` / `SetupTools` accordion rows
  (`SYSTEM · {first-line preview}` and `TOOLS · {N} tools`) instead
  of dumping the full prompt as a noisy warning-gutter row. The user
  expands when they want detail
- `TurnStats` row (no gutter, no fill, right-aligned muted caption
  `in 1,284 · cached 980 · out 86`) interleaved after each
  Assistant message. `conversation_to_display_items` walks
  `snapshot.turn_log` in lockstep with assistant turns; live
  streaming appends from `ThreadAssistantEnd { usage }`
- pane-header provenance chips: `via {behavior_id}` for behavior-
  spawned threads, `forked from {short_id}` for continued threads,
  `dispatched from {short_id}` for dispatched children. Muted
  badges between the title and state badge so the user can see
  the trigger context without opening the (eventual) thread
  inspector. `short_id` truncates to 12 chars + `…` so chips
  stay compact
- destructive failure banner above the chat log when the thread
  is `state == Failed && view.failure.is_some()`. `view.failure`
  is mirrored from `snapshot.failure` on subscribe; the wire-side
  `Error { thread_id, message, .. }` arm also writes it so a
  fresh failure surfaces before the next snapshot lands. The
  conjunction (state AND failure) avoids stale banners on
  recovered threads

### ✅ Stage 3 — Compose + send (commit `66d7c3e`)

Compose `text_area` + Send button at the bottom of the selected thread's
pane, controlled via `text_area::apply_event` and `App::selection`.
`SendUserMessage` fires on click, input clears.

`ThreadUserMessage`, `ThreadAssistantTextDelta`,
`ThreadAssistantReasoningDelta` wired into the per-thread `views` map so
generations paint live. Deltas coalesce onto the trailing item of their
own kind (one growing card, not one card per delta).

### ✅ Stage 4 — Compose into a fresh thread

The no-selection content pane is now a centered card with a
`form([...])` of three `select_trigger` pickers (Backend / Model /
Pod), a `text_area` compose, and a primary `Start` button. Pickers
go through `widgets::select` (`select_trigger` + conditional
`select_menu` riding the overlay layer); event routing uses
`select::classify_event` so picking a backend can side-effect into
clearing the model selection and firing a `ListModels` for the new
backend.

Still deferred:
- bindings surface (knowledge-db / behavior / shared MCP hosts) — the
  egui sibling exposes these as a collapsible "advanced" panel; we'll
  port it once Stage 8's modals exist as a precedent for the picker
  shape
- composing-new alongside an existing selection (the egui sibling's
  toggle between "send to selected thread" and "compose new"). Today
  the form is reachable only when no thread is selected.

Wire flow: `ConnectionOpened` fires `ListBackends` alongside
`ListPods` / `ListThreads`. Picking a backend triggers
`ListModels { backend }` once per connection (deduped by
`requested_models_for`). On send, `build_creation_request` resolves
`(config_override, pod_id)` from the picker state — including
falling through to the picked backend's `default_model` or first
fetched model so the server doesn't accidentally use the wrong
backend's default. `ThreadCreated` auto-selects the new thread when
no current selection (so the post-create transition lands the user
in the live conversation).

### ✅ Stage 5 — Drafts, prefill progress

Per-thread compose drafts: `ChatApp.drafts: HashMap<String, String>`
holds one buffer per thread the user has touched. The compose
`text_area` binds to `drafts[selected]` when a thread is selected
and to `compose_input` for the new-thread form (the latter remains
the only buffer for the no-selection case).

`SetThreadDraft` fires on every text-changing edit — bandwidth is
trivial vs. the value of always-persistent drafts, and a per-frame
clock-debounce doesn't ride the build/on_event split cleanly.
`ThreadDraftUpdated` broadcasts (other clients editing the same
thread) overwrite the local buffer wholesale; the server only
fans out to non-senders so we never receive our own echo.
Snapshot `draft` field hydrates `drafts[id]` on subscribe.
Selection cursor resets on thread switch (offsets index a
different string).

`ThreadPrefillProgress` renders as a thin `progress(...)` bar plus
a muted token-count caption between the toolbar and the
chat-log scroll. Cleared on first text/reasoning delta — the
protocol guarantees prefill events stop once the model starts
emitting output.

Deferred to a later slice:
- per-keystroke fanout debounce (chrono-backed wall clock or a
  frame-counter) — currently every keystroke hits the wire
- per-message hover affordances (copy, fork-from-here) — wants
  precedent from Stage 8's modals (fork dialog) first

### ✅ Stage 6 — Tool calls and tool results

Tool rows are now real `accordion_item`s with role-coded gutters
(WARNING for in-flight / success, DESTRUCTIVE for errors) and a
`code_block` body that shows args, streaming output (when in
flight), and integrated result. The header carries a status glyph
(⏳ / ✓ / ✗) plus the tool name so a closed row communicates pass /
fail at a glance.

Snapshot walk fuses `ContentBlock::ToolUse` + `ContentBlock::ToolResult`
into a single row when they're adjacent (no intervening user /
assistant text turn) — same fusion the egui sibling does. Streaming
events `ThreadToolCallBegin`, `ThreadToolCallContent`,
`ThreadToolCallEnd`, and `ThreadToolCallStreaming` (args-being-typed
placeholder) all land into the same row shape.

Header polish (commits `55269bb` / `39617e3`):
- collapsed row appends the first-line result preview after the
  glyph + name so a closed row reads `✓ list_files · drwxr-xr-x
  rust-stdlib/` rather than just `✓ list_files`
- relevant arg surfaces in `[brackets]` between name and preview
  (`✓ read_file [src/lib.rs] · pub mod foo;`), pulled by
  `tool_summary_from_args` from the tool's well-known field
  (`path`, `command`, `pattern`, …). Same heuristic as egui's
  `tool_summary`, plus aliases for whisper-agent's own tool
  catalog (`run_bash`, `list_files`)
- streaming tool calls (`result.is_none() && !streaming_output.is_empty()`)
  auto-expand so the user sees output scroll without clicking;
  collapse back when `End` lands and the buffer clears (commit
  `8a3db38`)

Diff rendering landed: `edit_file` (`old_string` / `new_string`)
and `write_file` (`content`, treated as a creation) tool calls now
resolve a `DiffPayload` at conversion time and render through
`diff_body` instead of dumping raw JSON args. Lines come through
`similar::TextDiff::from_lines` and paint as monospace rows with
`+` / `-` / ` ` prefixes, colored via two registered theme tokens
(`diff-add-foreground`, `diff-del-foreground`) — the destructive /
success tokens read poorly on the muted body fill, so we declare
GitHub-shaped hues that the bundle linter accepts.

Still deferred:
- async `dispatch_thread` callbacks routing into the originating
  call's result slot — currently they fall through to a standalone
  `ToolResult` row when the call has scrolled out of fusion range
- streaming-args placeholder text (`writing args · {N} chars`) —
  egui shows progress while args JSON is being typed; aetna pushes
  a name-only `ToolCall` placeholder which works but doesn't
  signal "still arriving"

### ✅ Stage 7 — Images / attachments

Inbound rendering: `ContentBlock::Image { source: Bytes, .. }` and
`ServerToClient::ThreadAssistantImage { source }` decode through the
`image` crate at push time (PNG / JPEG / WebP / GIF — HEIC/HEIF land
as a `Failed` placeholder until a HEIC dep is on the table). The
decoded pixels become an `aetna_core::image::Image` cached inside
`DisplayItem::Image` so rebuilds don't redecode. `event_log_row` then
renders the image through aetna's `image()` widget at a capped
display height (320px max — preserves aspect, never up-scales) with
a small dimensions caption. URL sources fall through to a muted
placeholder + the URL caption (no fetch yet); decode errors surface
as a destructive-text + reason caption row.

Input/staging landed once aetna upstream shipped
`UiEventKind::FileDropped` / `FileHovered` /
`FileHoverCancelled` and `aetna-winit-wgpu` wired the matching
`WindowEvent::DroppedFile` into the renderer's event surface.

`ChatApp` grew four fields:
- `compose_attachments: Vec<StagedAttachment>` — staged image
  rows. Each carries the canonical `Attachment` (drains into
  outbound `SendUserMessage` / `CreateThread` on submit), a
  pre-decoded `aetna_core::Image` for the thumbnail, and a
  monotonic `id` so duplicates the user staged deliberately
  remain individually addressable through
  `compose:attach:remove:{id}`.
- `next_attachment_id: u64` — counter for the id above.
- `pending_picks: Arc<Mutex<Vec<RawPick>>>` — async handoff
  queue from the rfd file picker thread. `before_build`
  drains it through the same `stage_raw_pick` pipeline that
  drag-drop uses, so success / rejection diagnostics don't
  drift between input sources.
- `compose_hint: Option<(String, Instant)>` — ephemeral
  status line under the thumbnail strip, self-expiring after
  4 seconds. Surfaces feedback on every attach attempt
  (success, MIME mismatch, read errors) so silently-rejected
  drops stop being silent.

`on_event`'s `UiEventKind::FileDropped` arm reads the path
synchronously, MIME-sniffs (`sniff_image_mime` mirrors the
egui sibling — magic-byte checks for jpeg / png / gif / webp /
heic / heif; unknown shapes get rejected with a hint), pre-
decodes a thumbnail, and pushes onto `compose_attachments`.
The compose bar grew a `paperclip` icon-button keyed
`compose:attach`; native click spawns rfd's `AsyncFileDialog`
on a background `std::thread::spawn` driven by a tokio
current-thread runtime (xdg-portal backend; no GTK3
dependency). Wasm-side click sets a "not yet" hint until
Stage 11 wires the browser path.

The compose bar's row now hosts text_area + paperclip + send
horizontally, with a thumbnail strip + hint paragraph
stacked above it via a wrapping column. Each thumbnail tile
is 96×96 with an `x` icon-button overlaid for one-click
removal and a truncated filename caption below.

Clipboard image paste landed. Wasm goes through the document-
level `install_paste_handler` in `web_entry.rs` (already in
place since Stage 11). Native intercepts Ctrl/Cmd+V on the
compose `text_area` via `text_input::clipboard_request`, then
calls `arboard::Clipboard::get_image()`; on success the RGBA8
bytes get PNG-encoded and pushed through the same
`stage_raw_pick` pipeline drag-drop uses. No clipboard image →
the routed Paste falls through to `text_area::apply_event` —
text paste in this app's text inputs is a separate gap (no
text-paste path is wired in any on_event branch today).

Also still deferred:
- URL fetching via the host shell (caching + a placeholder while
  in-flight)
- inline images in `ContentBlock::ToolResult` bodies (today
  collapsed via `tool_result_text_summary`'s text-only extractor)

### 🌗 Stage 8 — Modals (in flight)

`dialog` is the widget for centered form modals; `sheet` is the
fit for document-shaped surfaces (anything multi-column or
multi-tab). The egui sibling has 8 modals, each a few hundred
lines:
- settings (server config, shared MCP hosts, embedding providers)
- knowledge buckets
- ✅ behavior editor (v1: name / description / trigger kind /
  cron schedule / prompt — sheet, not dialog)
- ✅ pod editor (raw TOML — sheet, not dialog)
- ✅ new pod
- ✅ new behavior
- ✅ fork thread (paired with per-User-row hover affordance)
- file / JSON / image viewers

**Pattern landed with the `+ New pod` modal:**

- Per-modal state struct (`NewPodModalState`) wrapped in
  `Option<…>` on `ChatApp` — `Some` while open, `None` while
  closed; opening twice resets the form (matches the user's
  intent of "start over").
- Routed-key prefix (`new-pod:…`) covering scrim dismiss, the
  text inputs, and the primary / cancel buttons. The dialog's
  scrim auto-emits `{prefix}:dismiss` so we don't have to wire
  it explicitly.
- `correlation_id`-based wire round-trip: the modal stamps a
  monotonic id on `CreatePod` and stays open with a disabled
  primary button until either `PodCreated` (close + switch tab
  to the new pod) or `Error { correlation_id }` (re-enable +
  surface `message`). Match by id, not pod_id, so an unrelated
  echo from another client can't accidentally close the modal.
- Dialog body composes shadcn-shaped primitives: `dialog_header`
  (title + description) → `form` (two `form_item`s, each
  label / control / description) → optional `alert` blocks
  (server warning, validation error) → `dialog_footer`
  (cancel + create).
- Renderer hangs off `popover_layers()` so it overlays whatever
  surface was underneath without restructuring the chat content.

Validation lives client-side (`validate_pod_id_client`,
empty-fields and duplicate-id checks); the server runs the same
checks plus a few more during `CreatePod` and any rejection
echoes back through the `Error` path. `fresh_pod_config` is
deliberately the lighter of the two egui paths — it only knows
about `backends`, not the default-pod TOML template — so it
lands a working pod the user can edit afterwards. A
`GetPod`-based default-template clone is a follow-up.

The remaining modals slot into this scaffolding pattern.

**Behavior editor sheet (landed):** the first modal that uses
`sheet` (right-attached `SheetSide::Right`) instead of a
centered `dialog`. The on-disk surface is too wide for a
form-shaped dialog — full egui parity has 7 tabs (Trigger,
Thread, Scope, Retention, Prompt, System Prompt, Raw TOML).
The aetna v1 ships the 80% case as a single scrollable form:
name, description (multi-line `text_area` so production-shaped
~100-char descriptions wrap), trigger kind picker (manual /
cron / webhook), cron schedule (visible only when kind ==
Cron), and prompt `text_area`. Fields not exposed by the form
ride through `working_config` unchanged on save — the editor
holds a clone of the loaded `BehaviorConfig` and only mutates
the surfaced fields, so a v1 edit can never strip thread
overrides, scope, retention, or the system-prompt override
config.

Lifecycle:
1. Edit click on the per-behavior toolbar opens the sheet,
   mints `pending_get` correlation, fires `GetBehavior`.
2. Sheet renders a "loading…" placeholder until the matching
   `BehaviorSnapshot` arrives. Hydrate populates
   `working_config` + `working_prompt`; trigger kind +
   schedule are derived from the variant tag (preserving
   timezone / overlap / catch_up for cron in baseline so a
   no-op save never rewrites them).
3. Save mints `pending_save`, ships `UpdateBehavior` with
   `system_prompt: None` (v1 must not clobber the override
   file the form doesn't expose). `BehaviorUpdated` echo
   closes the sheet on correlation match; an `Error` surfaces
   into the same destructive `alert` slot client-side
   validation uses.

The body is wrapped in a `scroll(...)` between header and
footer so the prompt's 160 px text_area + form items + alert
never overflow vertically inside the sheet's `Size::Fill`
panel. Trigger-kind picker rides on `popover_layers()` above
the sheet — same pattern the new-thread compose pickers use,
extended in `close_other_pickers` to include this menu so the
single-active-menu invariant holds.

**Behavior editor — tabs strip + structured Trigger tab
(landed):** rewrites the editor body around a 7-tab strip
(Trigger / Thread / Scope / Retain / Prompt / System / Raw)
matching the egui sibling. Sheet width bumped to 600 px from
the stock 360 px — 7 labels at the narrow width all overflow.
"Retention" is shortened to "Retain" so the strip lints clean.

The Trigger tab body has identity (name + description), the
trigger-kind picker, and a kind-conditional sub-form:
- **Manual** — a hint paragraph; no further config.
- **Cron** — schedule + timezone text inputs, plus
  `overlap` / `catch_up` `select_trigger`s driven by a new
  `BehaviorEditorPicker` enum (single-active-at-a-time via
  `close_other_pickers`).
- **Webhook** — `overlap` picker + an endpoint hint
  showing `POST /triggers/{pod}/{behavior}`.

`BehaviorEditorSheetState` grew `timezone_buffer`,
`overlap_buffer`, `catch_up_buffer` (preserved across kind
switches so toggling Cron→Webhook→Cron doesn't lose typed
values), `tab: BehaviorEditorTab`, and `open_picker:
Option<BehaviorEditorPicker>`. Hydrate seeds all the buffers
from the snapshot's `TriggerSpec` variant; `resolved_trigger`
rebuilds the variant from the live buffers on save.

The Prompt tab body is the existing `prompt.md` text_area
relocated under its own tab (was the trailing form item in
the previous single-form layout).

**Cron preview + presets (landed):** new `cron_preview`
sub-module mirrors webui's verbatim — `parse_schedule` (5-field
with `"0 "` seconds prefix matching the server's scheduler),
`parse_tz` (chrono_tz IANA names), `CRON_PRESETS` /
`COMMON_TIMEZONES` static tables, plus `next_firings` and
`format_relative` for the preview body. Six unit tests
cover the parsers and `format_relative`'s output shapes.

In the editor, the Cron arm of the Trigger tab grew preset
chip rows (CRON_PRESETS as 4-then-3, COMMON_TIMEZONES as 3×3)
plus a preview form item. Aetna doesn't flex-wrap rows, so
chip rows are split into multiple `row(...)`s under one
`column(...)`. Click routing on a chip rewrites the
schedule/timezone buffer by index — keys carry the array
position, not the literal expression, to avoid escaping
`* / -` inside routed key strings.

The preview body parses the live schedule + timezone buffers
each frame, renders a destructive paragraph on parse failure,
or a `next 5 firings ({tz})` header followed by a column of
`[mono(timestamp), muted(relative)]` rows. `Utc::now()` makes
the preview wall-clock-dependent — fine for rendering, makes
bundle outputs non-deterministic across runs (they're not
committed, so no churn).

**Behavior editor — Thread tab scalar overrides (landed):**
ports the egui sibling's `render_behavior_editor_thread_tab`'s
"Thread overrides" section. Each scalar field on
`BehaviorThreadOverride` (`model`, `max_tokens`, `max_turns`)
becomes a `[checkbox, override-label, control]` row — the
checkbox flips `Some/None`, the control is a `select_trigger`
or `numeric_input` when on, a muted `(inherit pod default)`
paragraph when off. Default-on values match the egui pre-fill
(empty model string, 16384 tokens, 30 turns).

`BehaviorEditorSheetState` grew `thread_max_tokens_buf` /
`thread_max_turns_buf` (same buffer-then-parse-back pattern as
the pod editor's Defaults numeric inputs);
`sync_thread_buffers_from_config` seeds them at hydrate.
`BehaviorEditorPicker::ThreadModel` joins the picker family;
its menu reads from
`models_by_backend[bindings.backend.unwrap_or("")]` (the
binding sub-slice will fix the backend lookup against the
pod's effective default).

The bindings sub-struct (`backend` / `host_env` / `mcp_hosts`)
is deferred to its own sub-slice — they share the
override-checkbox shape but each carries its own catalog
lookup, and folding them into this commit doubled its size.

**Behavior editor — Thread bindings backend (landed):**
adds the `bindings.backend` override row using the global
`self.backends` catalog. `BehaviorEditorPicker::ThreadBackend`
joins the picker family. Picking a backend clears the model
override (its prior id is almost certainly invalid for the
new backend) — same shape as the pod editor's Defaults
backend pick.

`bindings.host_env` and `bindings.mcp_hosts` are still
deferred — they want the pod's `[allow.host_env]` /
`[allow.mcp_hosts]` lists as their option set, which means
the behavior editor needs to load the pod's full config.
Plumbing that fetch is a separate slice; until it lands the
two override fields ride through `working_config` unchanged
on save.

**Behavior editor — SystemPrompt tab (landed):** the
behavior's optional override for the spawned thread's
agent-personality preamble. An override checkbox flips
`cfg.thread.system_prompt` between `None` (inherit pod
default) and `Some(File { name = behaviors/<id>/system_prompt.md })`.
When on with the File variant, a 280 px text_area binds to a
new `working_system_prompt: Option<String>` buffer
(hydrated from `snapshot.system_prompt`); `submit_behavior_editor`
ships the buffer as `UpdateBehavior.system_prompt`, and the
server writes it to the conventional sibling path. The Text
variant binds the text_area directly to the inline string —
no side-file write, content rides through `config` itself.

Toggle-off drops the config reference but leaves
`working_system_prompt` alone, so toggling back on doesn't
lose the user's draft. Non-conventional file paths surface a
muted "edits land at the conventional path" warning since
`UpdateBehavior` only writes the canonical
`behaviors/<id>/system_prompt.md`.

**Behavior editor — Retention tab (landed):** the on-completion
policy editor. A `select_trigger` 3-way kind picker (Keep /
ArchiveAfterDays / DeleteAfterDays) plus a `numeric_input`
`days` row that's only rendered for the timed variants.
`BehaviorEditorPicker::RetentionKind` joins the picker family
and `retention_days_buf: String` lives on
`BehaviorEditorSheetState` (default `"30"` so a Keep → Archive
flip lands at the same default the egui sibling uses).
`sync_retention_buffer_from_config` seeds the buffer at hydrate.
Picking a timed variant re-applies the live buffer's parsed
days, so kind switches in the live editor preserve typed
values.

All structured tabs and the Raw TOML escape hatch landed.

**Pod editor sheet (landed):** mirrors the behavior editor's
sheet shape but the body is much simpler — a single
monospace `text_area` over the pod's raw `pod.toml`. The wire
surface (`UpdatePodConfig { toml_text: String }`) takes the
text directly; the server parses + validates and replies with
`Error` on parse failure (surfaced inline) or
`PodConfigUpdated` on success (closes the sheet on correlation
match). The text_area's default Hug height combined with the
outer `scroll` lets long pod.tomls scroll the whole sheet body
rather than clipping internally.

**Fork-thread dialog + per-row hover affordance (landed):**
the first slice that uses aetna's new `BuildCx::is_hovering_within(key)`
+ subtree-interaction-envelope cascade (upstream gh#9 / gh#10).
Each User row in the chat log gets a keyed wrapper
(`chat:user-row:{idx}`) and `event_log_row` reads
`is_hovering_within(row_key)` during build to decide whether to
render a `git-branch` icon-button next to the user text. Click
on the affordance routes through `chat:user-fork:{msg_index}`,
which opens the fork dialog pre-populated with the clicked
message's `from_message_index` + seed text.

The fork dialog itself is a regular `dialog`-shaped modal: an
explainer paragraph + two `switch`-shaped form items (Archive
original — default on; Reset capabilities — default off). Confirm
mints a correlation, ships `ClientToServer::ForkThread`, and
stashes `(correlation, seed_text)` in `pending_fork_seed`. The
matching `ThreadCreated` echo (correlation-matched) seeds the new
thread's `drafts[new_id]` slot with the captured prompt and auto-
selects the new thread — so the user lands on a compose box that's
ready for "edit slightly and resend." Mirrors the egui sibling's
`pending_fork_seed` flow.

`DisplayItem::User` grew a `msg_index: usize` field for this. The
snapshot path computes it from the message's position in
`Conversation.messages()`. Streaming `ThreadUserMessage` reads it
from a new `ThreadView::next_msg_index` counter that hydrates
from the snapshot's message count and bumps on commit-shaped wire
arms (`ThreadUserMessage`, `ThreadAssistantEnd`,
`ThreadToolResultMessage`).

**Hover note:** the affordance is hover-conditional in the live
binary but always rendered in the bundle dump's `ForkModalOpen`
scene — synthetic clicks route by key alone, so the click
through to the modal doesn't depend on the affordance being
visually rendered. Bundle-side hover simulation needs a
`UiState`-injecting `BuildCx` and isn't worth the surface area
for one scene.

Entry point: a `settings`-icon button in the sidebar header,
rendered only when some pod tab is active. Single key
(`sidebar:pod-settings`) — at any moment exactly one pod is
active, so the click target is implicitly scoped to whatever's
selected.

Save short-circuits the no-op case (`working_toml ==
baseline_toml`) so a re-save without edits surfaces "no
changes to save" rather than a wire round-trip. v1 explicitly
does not surface a structured form (allow lists, host_envs,
MCP hosts, sandbox, thread_defaults) — those land in
follow-up slices that mirror the egui pod editor's
multi-tabbed shape, but the raw-only path covers the 80%
case (and remains the escape hatch for any malformed config
the structured form can't represent).

**Pod editor — Allow tab + tabs strip (landed):** first
structured slice on top of the raw-TOML escape hatch. The
sheet body now starts with a 4-button tabs strip
(Allow / Defaults / Limits / Raw) that switches between
structured tabs and the legacy text_area. State grows a
`working_config: Option<PodConfig>` (the structured side's
truth) plus `working_toml`/`raw_dirty` (the raw side's
escape hatch). `switch_tab()` enforces the sync invariant:
leaving Raw with `raw_dirty == true` reparses the toml back
into `working_config` (or surfaces the parse error and bounces
the user back to Raw); entering Raw re-serializes the structured
state so the user sees a fresh round-trip. `resolved_save_toml()`
returns whichever side is authoritative for the active tab —
raw text when Raw is current and dirty, otherwise
`toml::to_string_pretty(working_config)`.

The Allow tab itself ports the egui sibling's
`render_allow_tab`: identity (id is read-only / created_by is
read-only / display_name + description text fields), allowed
backends (multi-check across `state.backends`), allowed shared
MCP hosts (multi-check across `state.shared_mcp_hosts`),
allowed knowledge buckets (multi-check across `state.buckets`),
plus the three pod-modify / dispatch / behaviors caps as
`select_triggers` driven by the new `PodEditorPicker` enum.
Catalog wiring: app state grew `shared_mcp_hosts:
Vec<SharedMcpHostInfo>` and `buckets: Vec<BucketSummary>`, both
hydrated from `ClientToServer::List{SharedMcpHosts,Buckets}` at
boot (mirrors the existing `ListPods` / `ListBackends` arms).

Multi-checks use a custom `checkbox_column` helper rather than
aetna's `toggle_group_multi`, since the latter doesn't wrap and
the 360px sheet width truncates 4+ items. The helper renders a
column of `[checkbox, label]` rows that all share a single key
prefix; click routing collects the picked id via
`apply_checkbox_list_to_vec()` (push if missing, remove if
present) into the corresponding `Vec<String>` on `working_config`.

`PodEditorPicker` originally carried
`#[allow(clippy::enum_variant_names)]` to keep the `AllowCaps*`
prefix grouping; the Defaults-tab slice added
`DefaultsBackend` / `DefaultsModel` / `DefaultsToolGate` /
`DefaultsCaps*` variants which broke the shared prefix, so the
attribute is gone and the lint stays quiet on its own. The
enum gained a `key()` method that maps each variant to its
routed `select_trigger` key so `close_other_pickers`,
`handle_pod_editor_picker`, and `pod_editor_picker_menu` no
longer carry separate per-variant key tables.

**Pod editor — Defaults tab (landed):** structured port of the
egui sibling's `render_pod_editor_defaults_tab`. Form items:
backend / model `select_trigger`s (catalog-driven; backend
options carry `(not in allow)` suffix labels for catalog rows
that aren't in `allow.backends`, matching the egui sibling's
"would error on save" warning shape), `system_prompt_file`
text input, `max_tokens` / `max_turns` aetna `numeric_input`s,
tool-gate default + per-cap defaults `select_trigger`s, and
host_env / mcp_hosts multi-checks scoped to the pod's
`allow.host_env` / `allow.mcp_hosts` lists. Per-tool overrides
defer to the Raw tab (the egui sibling does the same — they're
an unbounded `String → Disposition` map; a structured editor
would balloon the sheet).

`max_tokens_buf` / `max_turns_buf` live on `PodEditorSheetState`
because aetna's `numeric_input` owns its visible text as an
external `String` (so mid-edit states like `"1"` survive
between keystrokes). The handler parses each parseable buffer
back into the `working_config.thread_defaults.{max_tokens,
max_turns}` u32 on every event so `dirty()` and the save
round-trip stay accurate. Buffers re-sync from
`working_config` on hydrate and after Raw → structured
reparses, via a new `sync_buffers_from_config()` helper.

The Defaults backend pick clears `thread_defaults.model` (the
prior model id is almost certainly invalid for the new
backend); the model menu options come from
`models_by_backend[thread_defaults.backend]`, so changing
backends routes the user to a fresh pick on the next click.

**Pod editor — Limits tab (landed):** trivial slice — the
protocol's [`PodLimits`] struct only carries
`max_concurrent_threads` today, so the form is one
`numeric_input` (1–1000, step 1). Same buffer pattern as the
Defaults numeric inputs (`max_concurrent_threads_buf` lives on
`PodEditorSheetState`, parsed back to `working_config.limits`
on every event). New form items drop in alongside as the
schema grows.

**Pod & behavior editors — modal conversion (landed):** the
right-attached sheets were always a compromise — even at 600 px
the behavior editor's 7-tab strip and the Defaults / Thread /
Scope rows felt cramped, and the egui sibling has always used a
centered `egui::Window::new(...).anchor(CENTER_CENTER)` shape.
Both editors swapped to `dialog_content` panels (720 × 640,
matching egui's `default_width(720) / default_height(560)` plus
headroom for aetna's larger form_item gaps), centered via
`overlay([scrim, panel]).align(Align::Center).justify(Justify::Center)`.
Same `dialog_header` / `scroll(body)` / `dialog_footer` anatomy
as the create modals; only the panel sizing differs. Picker
menus (`select_menu` overlays) anchor to their `select_trigger`
keys regardless of where the parent dialog sits, so no rework
to `behavior_editor_picker_menu` /
`behavior_editor_trigger_kind_menu` / `pod_editor_picker_menu`
was needed. State struct names (`PodEditorSheetState` /
`BehaviorEditorSheetState`) and key prefixes (`pod-editor:` /
`behavior-editor:`) stay as-is — they're internal and the
churn isn't worth it. Renderer entry points are now
`render_{pod,behavior}_editor_modal`.

**Behavior editor — pod_config plumbing + Thread bindings
host_env / mcp_hosts (landed):** the Thread tab's host_env /
mcp_hosts override rows landed as a placeholder paragraph
("…land in a follow-up sub-slice once the editor loads the
pod's allow lists"). This slice hooks them up.

`BehaviorEditorSheetState` grew `pod_config: Option<PodConfig>`
and `pending_pod_get: Option<String>`. `open_behavior_editor`
mints a second correlation alongside the existing `GetBehavior`
correlation and fires `GetPod` in parallel; both round-trips
race, and whichever lands first hydrates its slice (so the
prompt / trigger fields show up the instant the behavior
snapshot lands, even if the pod snapshot is still in flight).
The `PodSnapshot` inbound arm grew a second match: the existing
pod-editor branch stays, and a new behavior-editor branch checks
the open editor's `pending_pod_get` correlation + `pod_id` and
stashes `snapshot.config` into `pod_config`.

The Thread tab now renders host_env / mcp_hosts override rows
in the same `[checkbox, override-text, value-or-hint]` shape as
the existing model / max_tokens / max_turns / backend rows. With
override OFF (the default), the value cell renders the standard
"(inherit pod default)" muted hint. With override ON, the cell
checks `pending_pod_get` first ("(loading pod allow list…)"
while in flight), then renders a `checkbox_column` over the
pod's `allow.host_env` / `allow.mcp_hosts` names, identical to
the pod editor's Defaults tab multi-checks. Empty allow lists
surface "(no host envs in pod [allow])" / "(no shared MCP hosts
in pod [allow])" so the user knows they need to widen the pod
first.

Two new override-checkbox handlers and two new
`apply_checkbox_list_to_vec` calls cover the new keys
(`behavior-editor:thread:host-env:override` /
`behavior-editor:thread:host-env:item:{name}` and the
mcp-hosts mirror). Same Some/None toggle pattern as the
backend override: ON seeds `Some(Vec::new())` (empty
override = "bind to none"), OFF drops to `None` (inherit pod
default).

Bundle scenes that open the behavior editor now answer both
`GetBehavior` and `GetPod` (the SendFn match arm grew from
single-pattern `if let` to a `match` over both wire kinds), so
the dump's second `before_build` pass sees a populated
`pod_config` and the host_env / mcp_hosts inherit hints render
the same way they will in the live binary.

**Behavior editor — Scope tab (landed):** ports the egui
sibling's `render_behavior_editor_scope_tab`. Every field on
[`BehaviorScope`] is `Option`-shaped (`None` = inherit pod
ceiling), so each row is the same `[checkbox, "override",
value-or-inherit]` shape the Thread tab settled on. Eight
form items: three resource-set multi-checks (backends /
host_envs / mcp_hosts) over the pod's allow lists; the
`tools.default` Disposition picker (`allow` / `deny`) plus an
override-count text reading "(N per-tool override(s) — edit
via Raw TOML)" since per-tool overrides are an unbounded
`String → Disposition` map; three cap pickers (pod_modify /
dispatch / behaviors); and a tool-surface row whose ON state
shows a "(structured editor coming in a follow-up; use Raw
TOML to edit fields)" hint, deferred for the same reason as
the pod editor's Defaults `tool_surface` sub-slice.

`BehaviorEditorPicker` grew four variants
(`ScopeToolsDefault` / `ScopeCapsPodModify` /
`ScopeCapsDispatch` / `ScopeCapsBehaviors`); the picker-
iteration list, picker-handler match, and `picker_menu`
options switch picked up new arms. Override toggles seed
sensible identity-under-narrow defaults: resource sets
toggle `Some(Vec::new())` ↔ `None`; tools toggles
`Some(AllowMap::allow_all())` ↔ `None`; caps toggle a
ceiling-shaped value (`PodModifyCap::ModifyAllow`,
`DispatchCap::WithinScope`, `BehaviorOpsCap::AuthorAny`) ↔
`None`; tool_surface toggles `Some(ToolSurface::default())` ↔
`None`. New `disposition_label` / `disposition_from_wire`
helpers cover the bare `allow`/`deny` shape (distinct from
the pod editor's `tool_gate_label`'s `_all`-suffixed shape —
the Scope tools default isn't a pod-wide gate).

A new `behavior_editor_scope_tab` bundle scene exercises the
tab; the architect mock has `BehaviorScope::default()` so
every row renders in the inherit-only state — useful for the
structured layout, even though the override-on multi-checks
and cap pickers don't show.

**Pod editor — Defaults tool_surface (landed):** the Defaults
tab placeholder paragraph for `thread_defaults.tool_surface`
got replaced with the structured editor that mirrors the egui
sibling's `render_tool_surface_editor`: three sections under a
single form_item, each headed by a small label.
- **`Wire tools: core set`** — a 2-option `radio_group`
  (`all` vs `named`); when `named` is selected, a multi-line
  monospace `text_area` (96 px, one tool per line) takes over.
  The named buffer lives on `PodEditorSheetState` so mid-edit
  states like a trailing newline survive between keystrokes.
- **`System-prompt listing`** — a 3-option `radio_group`
  (`none` / `all_names` / `core_only`).
- **`Mid-conversation activation`** — a 2-option `radio_group`
  (`announce` / `inject_schema`).

The radio routes use `aetna_core::widgets::radio::apply_event`
with the tab's matching `_from_wire` parser (e.g.
`initial_listing_from_wire`); the textarea routes through
`text_area::apply_event` and parses-and-writes-back to
`CoreTools::Named(parse_core_tools_named(buf))` on every
keystroke. New helpers: `default_core_tools_text` (seed for
the `All → Named` toggle), `parse_core_tools_named`, and the
three `_label` / `_from_wire` pairs for `InitialListing` and
`ActivationSurface`.

The named buffer hydrates from
`sync_buffers_from_config`: `CoreTools::Named` joins the list
back to a newline-separated string; `CoreTools::All` falls
back to `default_core_tools_text()` so toggling `All → Named`
lands the conventional default text without a separate
keystroke. The matching textarea-driven write-back also
parses on every edit, so a stray empty line trims out before
landing in `CoreTools::Named`.

The existing `pod_editor_defaults_tab` bundle scene picks up
the new editor without changes — `mock_default_pod_snapshot`
ships `tool_surface: Default::default()` (which is
`CoreTools::Named` of the conventional three names), so the
scene shows the named buffer populated and the radio at
`named`.

**Behavior editor — Raw TOML tab (landed):**
`BehaviorEditorSheetState` grew `working_toml: String` and
`raw_dirty: bool`. Hydrate seeds the buffer from
`toml::to_string_pretty(snapshot.config)` so a first visit
to Raw shows the round-tripped TOML rather than a blank
pane. Tab routing now goes through a new `switch_tab`
helper modeled on the pod editor's: leaving Raw with
`raw_dirty` reparses the buffer back into `working_config`
(re-deriving the trigger-kind / cron / numeric / retention
buffers in the process so the structured tabs reflect the
just-typed TOML); a parse error keeps the user on Raw with
the message in `error`. Entering Raw re-serializes from
`working_config` after applying `resolved_trigger()` so
pending kind / cron buffer edits survive the round-trip.

`submit_behavior_editor` grew the same Raw-current branch
the pod editor's `resolved_save_toml` carries: when the
user is on Raw with edits, the buffer parses to
`BehaviorConfig` and ships through `UpdateBehavior`
verbatim; a parse failure keeps the editor open with the
error surfaced in the destructive alert slot.

The Raw tab body is a hint paragraph above a `text_area`
keyed `behavior-editor:raw-toml`. The textarea uses Hug
height (the editor modal's outer scroll handles overflow,
matching the pod editor's Raw shape) and the wrapping
column carries `tokens::RING_WIDTH` of horizontal padding
so the textarea's focus ring isn't clipped by the scroll's
scissor (lint catches the bare-edge case).

A new `behavior_editor_raw_tab` bundle scene exercises the
tab — the architect mock's parsed config gets serialized on
hydrate, so the textarea shows the round-tripped TOML the
moment the scene paints.

### ✅ Stage 9 — Login form

`whisper_agent_aetna_ui::LoginApp` is a separate aetna [`App`] —
centered card with a server URL field, a password-masked token
field (`text_input_with(...).password()`), a "Remember on this
device" checkbox, and a primary Connect button. Submission rides a
host-supplied `SubmitFn` callback so the lib stays platform-agnostic
(both the wasm browser entry and the desktop binary will reuse it).

Desktop binary owns a `RootApp` that wraps either a `LoginApp` or
the existing `DesktopApp(ChatApp)` in a `Phase` enum. Startup
loads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/whisper-agent/desktop.toml` (same shape as
the egui sibling — both clients can share the file) and
auto-connects when both server URL and token are known. CLI flags
override saved config; `--login` forces the form even when both
are present.

Submission flow: `LoginApp::submit` writes to an
`Arc<Mutex<Option<LoginInput>>>` "phase signal" the host shell
reads in `before_build`. On a pending submission, the host
persists creds (gating token write on the "Remember" checkbox),
spawns the WS task, and swaps `Phase` to `Connected`. Failed
`derive_ws_url` calls bounce back to a fresh `LoginApp` with
`set_error(...)` carrying the parse error.

Bundle scenes: `LoginFormEmpty`, `LoginFormPrefilled`,
`LoginFormWithError`. The dump loop is now generic over
`Box<dyn App>` so future App variants (e.g. modal hosts) can join
without reshaping the loop.

### ✅ Stage 10 — Markdown rendering

`aetna-markdown` landed upstream and we now route assistant text
through `aetna_markdown::md(text)`. Pulldown-cmark walks the source
into headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, inline runs, and
emphasis — identical to a hand-authored aetna tree. Got picked up as
part of the event-log refactor since both touched the same code.

Future polish: per `aetna-markdown/src/lib.rs` at the version we
build against, tables, footnotes, task lists, raw HTML, and math
(`$…$` / `$$…$$`) are all still deferred upstream.

### ✅ Stage 11 — wasm browser entry + server bundle switch

Landed. The crate's `src/web_entry.rs` carries the
`#[wasm_bindgen(start)]` entry plus the wgpu+winit host shell — a
lift of `aetna-web/src/lib.rs` with the gfx slot constructor-injected
so the WebSocket / drag-drop / paste JS callbacks can call
`request_redraw` on the same window after pushing inbound events.
The HTML harness in `crates/whisper-agent-aetna-ui/assets/`
(`index.html`, `login.html`, favicons) mirrors the deleted egui
sibling's auth-probe pattern.

Server-side: `src/server.rs` repoints rust-embed at
`crates/whisper-agent-aetna-ui/{pkg,assets}/`. No feature flag — the
cutover was full. `scripts/dev.sh` and `Dockerfile` wasm-pack the
aetna-ui crate before building the agent so the embed sees fresh
output.

Eventual cleanup: upstream a public `aetna-web::start_with::<A>` so
this crate can stop carrying its own ~500-line copy of the browser
host shell. Until that lands, the duplication is intentional.

## Migration gaps from egui webui

Status of the long tail of smaller features that didn't slot under
any one stage. Recorded for the historical record now that the
cutover has landed; ✅ items are in tree, anything else marks a gap
we intentionally accepted at cutover time. Effort tags are
trivial / small / medium / large.

### Chat-log / per-message details

- ✅ **Per-turn token & cache stats.** `DisplayItem::TurnStats` (rendered
  via `turn_stats_text` in `app.rs`) emits `in 1,234 · cached 800 ·
  created 200 · out 567` after every assistant turn. Mirrors the egui
  sibling's `render_turn_stats` (chat_render.rs:865).
- ✅ **User-message inline thumbnails.** Wire arm now decodes each
  `Attachment::Image` in `ThreadUserMessage` and pushes a
  `DisplayItem::Image { is_user: true, … }` row, mirroring the
  snapshot path. (Snapshot path was already correct via
  `conversation_to_display_items`; live wire arm caught up.)

### Thread header / chrome

- ✅ **Backend / model chip.** Right-aligned caption under the title:
  `anthropic-prod/claude-opus-4-7`. Hydrated from
  `ThreadSnapshot::bindings.backend` + `config.model`.
- ✅ **Cumulative usage chip.** Right-aligned caption: `↑ in · ↓ out
  · cache r/c`. Hydrated from `ThreadSnapshot::total_usage`,
  incremented on each `ThreadAssistantEnd` arm. Mirrors egui's
  status-bar strip (app.rs:2693 in webui).

### Modals

- ✅ **Image lightbox.** Decoded inline images carry a click route
  (`chat:image-lightbox:{idx}`); the click hydrates a `LightboxState`
  slot and `render_lightbox_modal` paints a fullscreen `dialog` with
  the image at constrained max dims, a dimensions caption, and a
  Close button. Scrim auto-dismisses on outside-click.
- ✅ **JSON tree viewer.** `open_json_viewer(pod_id, path)` mints a
  correlation and fires `ReadPodFile`; the `PodFileContent` arm
  parses content into `serde_json::Value` and hydrates the modal
  (or surfaces a `parse JSON: …` error). Renderer is
  `render_json_viewer_modal` — `dialog_content` (720 × 560) with a
  scrollable body of recursive `render_json_node` rows. Scalars
  render as monospace one-liners; objects / arrays render via
  `json_node_trigger` (a tight chevron + monospace header — the
  built-in `accordion_trigger` was too heavy for a deep tree).
  Per-node collapse state lives in `json_tree_open` (separate from
  chat `open_accordions` so modal-close can drop it independently).
  String rows render the full quoted text with `.ellipsis()` +
  `Size::Fill(1.0)` so wide payloads clamp at the modal's inner
  width; each row carries a keyed `.tooltip(...)` (up to
  `STRING_TOOLTIP_BYTES = 600` since aetna's v1 tooltip is
  single-line / no-wrap) so hover reveals what was clipped, with
  the file viewer remaining the escape hatch for payloads beyond
  the cap. Entry point is public so the future file-tree slice
  can route `.json` clicks straight here.
- ✅ **File browser / editor.** Two slices, both landed.

  **Edit-with-save modal:** `open_file_viewer(pod_id, path)` mints
  a correlation and fires `ReadPodFile`; `PodFileContent` hydrates
  `working` + `baseline` + `readonly`; `WritePodFile` ships the
  buffer on Save, with `PodFileWritten` adopting the working
  buffer as the new baseline. Renderer is `render_file_viewer_modal`
  — `dialog_content` (720 × 560), single mono `text_area` body,
  footer Close / Revert / Save (Revert + Save disabled when
  buffer == baseline; both gone entirely when `readonly`). Bundle
  scenes: `FileViewerEditable`, `FileViewerReadOnly`.

  **File tree modal:** `open_file_tree_modal(pod_id)` primes a
  `ListPodDir` on the pod root and stamps `file_tree_modal_pod`.
  `PodDirListing` fans into `pod_files: HashMap<(pod_id, path),
  Vec<FsEntry>>`; `pod_files_requested` dedups in-flight asks.
  `pod_dirs_open` is the per-(pod, path) expansion set —
  clicks toggle membership and lazy-fetch on expand. Renderer
  is `render_file_tree_modal` (520 × 600 `dialog_content` over
  a scrolled column of recursive `render_pod_dir` rows: dirs
  carry chevron + name, files carry name only with muted color
  for `readonly`). Entry point is a folder `icon_button` in the
  sidebar header alongside the settings gear (rendered only when
  a pod tab is active). File clicks route through
  `classify_pod_file_path` to one of the four specialized
  openers: `open_pod_editor` (pod.toml), `open_behavior_editor`
  (behaviors/&lt;id&gt;/{behavior.toml,prompt.md}),
  `open_json_viewer` (*.json), or `open_file_viewer` (everything
  else). Bundle scene: `FileTreeOpen` (root + one expanded
  subdir, exercising every dispatch shape). The egui sibling's
  per-tab deep-link (Prompt clicks landing on the Prompt tab)
  is deferred until `open_behavior_editor` grows a per-tab
  variant.

  Reconnect drops `pod_files` + `pod_files_requested` so the
  in-flight guard doesn't wedge if the server restarts with a
  different on-disk layout.
- ✅ **Server settings.** All three tabs of the egui sibling's
  modal landed: LLM backends (catalog + per-`chatgpt_subscription`
  Codex auth rotate sub-form), Shared MCP (CRUD), and admin-only
  raw editor for `whisper-agent.toml`.

  Entry point is a `settings` icon-button in the sidebar footer
  (next to the server-URL line, since server settings aren't
  pod-scoped). State on `ChatApp`:
  `settings_modal: Option<SettingsModalState>` carries
  `active_tab` plus per-tab slots — `server_config`
  (lazy-fetched), `codex_rotate` + `codex_rotate_banner`,
  `shared_mcp_editor` + `shared_mcp_banner` +
  `shared_mcp_remove_armed`.

  Backends tab: per-backend cards (alias + kind row, optional
  default-model / auth-mode chips). `chatgpt_subscription` rows
  carry a "Rotate credentials" button that opens the
  `CodexRotateState` sub-form (pasted-auth.json text_area + Save +
  inline error). Save dispatches `UpdateCodexAuth` with a fresh
  correlation; `CodexAuthUpdated` echo with matching correlation
  closes the form and stamps the success banner above the catalog.
  Correlation-matching `Error` surfaces inline so the operator
  can fix the paste without retyping.

  Shared MCP tab: a "+ Add host" button + scrolled list of host
  rows, each with name + origin chip + connected indicator + URL +
  auth chip + last_error caption + Edit / Remove (two-click
  arm-confirm) buttons. The Add / Edit sub-form (a centered
  overlay above the settings dialog) collects name (locked on
  Edit) + url + auth picker (Anonymous / Bearer / OAuth, OAuth
  Add-only and only when `OAUTH_AVAILABLE`, which is the wasm
  target — native gates the option off) + bearer / scope per
  choice + tool-name prefix picker (Default / None / Custom).
  `submit_shared_mcp_editor` validates the form, builds a
  `SharedMcpSubmitRequest::{Add,Update}` via
  `build_shared_mcp_submit_request`, and dispatches the matching
  wire op. The "keep existing bearer" semantic on Edit is
  modeled inline: empty buffer + existing-bearer → elide the
  auth field; empty + no-existing → explicit clear; non-empty →
  set bearer.

  Wire arms: `SharedMcpHostAdded` / `SharedMcpHostUpdated`
  replace-or-insert by name, sort the list, and close the editor
  on correlation match (banner stamped). `SharedMcpHostRemoved`
  drops the row + clears the armed set. `SharedMcpOauthFlowStarted`
  flips `oauth_in_flight = true` and (on wasm) opens the
  authorization URL via `web_sys::window().open(...)`. Error arm
  fans out: matching codex_rotate / shared_mcp_editor /
  remove_shared_mcp_host correlations land inline.

  Server config tab: lazy-fetches via `FetchServerConfig` on
  first tab open (`ensure_server_config_fetched` is idempotent).
  `ServerConfigFetched` hydrates `original` + `working`. Save
  mints a fresh correlation and ships `UpdateServerConfig`; the
  `ServerConfigUpdateResult` reply adopts the working buffer as
  the new baseline and populates `save_summary` (cancelled
  threads, restart-required sections, pods referencing removed
  backends). Save / Revert are tab-scoped affordances above the
  text_area.

  Bundle scenes: `SettingsBackends` (read-only catalog),
  `SettingsServerConfig` (text_area populated via synthesized
  `ServerConfigFetched`), `SettingsCodexRotate` (sub-form open
  over a `chatgpt_subscription` backend),
  `SettingsSharedMcpList` (populated tab with the third row
  armed for removal — Confirm + Cancel pair renders),
  `SettingsSharedMcpEditorAdd` (Add sub-form fresh; OAuth toggle
  greyed because `OAUTH_AVAILABLE = false` on the bundle's
  native target), `SettingsSharedMcpEditorEdit` (Edit sub-form
  pre-populated from a bearer-auth host). All scenes lint clean.
- ✅ **Knowledge buckets.** All three phases landed: read-only catalog
  modal with per-row chrome, live build-progress display, last-
  failed-build error banner, per-row actions (Build / Pause build /
  Poll now / Resync now + arm-confirm Delete), the search-and-query
  interface above the catalog, and the +New bucket create form.

  **Phase 3 detail (search-and-query):** the modal grew a search
  section above the catalog cards. State on `BucketsModalState`:
  `selected_bucket`, `bucket_picker_open`, `query_input`,
  `top_k_buf` + `top_k`, `query_status: QueryStatus`,
  `pending_query_correlation`, `query_expanded: HashSet<chunk_id>`.
  `QueryStatus` is the four-arm `Idle / InFlight / Results /
  Error` enum the egui sibling uses.

  The picker is a standard `select_trigger` + `select_menu` pair —
  `bucket_picker_value` encodes the `(pod, id)` pair as
  `{pod_token}:{id}` so `SelectAction::Pick(String)` works without
  a parallel lookup table; `bucket_picker_value_parse` round-trips
  it back. The picker menu is an overlay layer in
  `popover_layers()` driven by `bucket_picker_open`. The query
  text input submits on plain Enter (the same modifier-gated
  branch the compose box uses) or on the Search button. `top_k`
  uses the numeric_input buffer-then-parse pattern, clamped
  `[1, 50]` to match the egui sibling.

  `QueryBuckets` ships with a fresh correlation; `QueryResults`
  matches `pending_query_correlation` and folds into
  `QueryStatus::Results`. A correlation-matching `Error` arm
  surfaces failure into `QueryStatus::Error` rather than the
  generic per-thread failure banner. Hits render with a chevron-
  + rank- + source-id row (or chunk-id fallback for hits with
  empty `source_id`), a meta row of via-chip (`dense` info color,
  `sparse` warning color), rerank + source scores, optional
  source locator + short chunk id, then an expandable body that
  swaps between a 180-char snippet (collapsed) and a wrapped
  paragraph wrapped in `code_block_chrome` (expanded — chunk
  text is prose, so we feed the chrome a wrap-mode body rather
  than `code_block`'s `nowrap` shape).

  Bundle scene: `BucketsModalSearchResults` exercises the open
  flow end-to-end — pre-seeds the picker + query buffer, fires
  Submit, the per-scene SendFn synthesizes a `QueryResults`
  reply with two hits (one with source_id + dense / one without
  source_id + sparse), and a synthetic click expands the first
  hit so the body paints. Lint clean.

  Entry point: a `database`-icon button in the sidebar footer
  next to the existing settings cog (bundled SVG — aetna's
  built-in registry doesn't ship `database`).
  `open_buckets_modal` is idempotent — re-opens preserve any
  live build-progress maps that were already populated.

  Wire surface for Phase 1:
  - Send: `StartBucketBuild`, `CancelBucketBuild`, `DeleteBucket`,
    `PollFeedNow`, `ResyncBucket` (all `id` + `pod_id` only —
    correlation ids unused since the broadcasts are
    matched by `(pod_id, bucket_id)` on the reply side).
  - Receive: `BucketCreated` (append iff not present), `BucketDeleted`
    (drop the row + per-row state), `BucketBuildStarted` (seed
    `build_progress`), `BucketBuildProgress` (update counters),
    `BucketBuildEnded` (drop `build_progress` + adopt new
    `summary` into the catalog when present, populate
    `build_errors` on `Error` outcome).

  Renderer is a 720 × 640 `dialog_content` over a scrolled
  column of cards. Slot state badge is colored by lifecycle
  (`ready` success, `building` / `planning` warning, `failed`
  destructive, `archived` muted). Build progress paints as a
  single warning-colored caption (`phase · count_body · elapsed`),
  mirroring the egui sibling's spinner row visually. Action
  keys carry pod-scope sentinel (`__server__` for `pod_id =
  None`) so `split_once(':')` parses cleanly even with pod ids
  that contain colons — kebab-case validator on the server
  precludes the actual collision.

  Bundle scene: `BucketsModalCatalog` synthesizes three
  buckets covering each row-chrome state (managed-no-slot,
  linked-in-flight-build, tracked-ready), plus a
  `BucketBuildStarted` + `BucketBuildProgress` pair driving
  the live counter row, plus a synthetic click that arms the
  `wiki-en` Delete button to render the destructive
  Confirm + Cancel pair. Lint clean.

  **Phase 2 detail (+New bucket create form):** a header-row
  toggle button flips `BucketsModalState::creating: Option<CreateBucketForm>`.
  When the form is open the dialog body hides search + catalog
  and devotes all available space to the form (wrapped in a
  scroll so even the tallest variant — `tracked` source with
  driver / language / mirror / cadences — fits inside the fixed
  720 × 640 frame). Form fields mirror the egui sibling: id,
  scope picker (server / per-pod), name, description, embedder
  picker (drives off `EmbeddingProvidersList` — falls back to
  a plain text input when the catalog is empty), source-kind
  toggle group (stored / linked / managed / tracked), the
  source-kind-specific sub-fields, chunk + overlap token
  numeric inputs, dense + sparse standalone toggles, and
  quantization picker. Submit goes through `submit_create_bucket`'s
  phased-borrow validate → mint → stamp → send pattern;
  `build_create_bucket_request` ports the egui sibling's local
  validation (id / name / embedder required, archive_path /
  path required for stored / linked, language required for
  tracked-wikipedia, http(s):// mirror check). The form's
  `pending_correlation` wires the round-trip: `BucketCreated`
  with a matching id closes the form; a correlation-matching
  `Error` surfaces into a destructive `alert`.

  Bundle scenes: `BucketsModalCreateForm` (default `linked`
  source) and `BucketsModalCreateFormTracked` (exercises the
  tracked sub-fields + cadence pickers). Both lint clean.

  Egui equivalent: `modals/buckets.rs` (1306 LOC).

### Sidebar / chrome

- ✅ **Pending-sudo banner.** `SudoRequested` populates a
  `pending_sudos: HashMap<u64, PendingSudoState>` slot keyed by
  `function_id`; the matching thread's pane renders one
  warning-styled `alert` per entry above the chat log, with
  Approve / Remember / Reject buttons + an optional reject-reason
  text input. Resolution is optimistic — the local slot is dropped
  before `ResolveSudo` ships so the banner doesn't flicker through
  the wire round-trip. `SudoResolved` echo cleans up server-side
  resolutions from any client.
- ✅ **Thread inspector.** Inline detail panel above the chat log,
  toggled by an `info` icon-button on the thread toolbar (next to
  the state badge). Aetna doesn't yet have an anchored-popover
  primitive, so v1 ships the surface as an inline collapsible:
  click toggles `inspector_open: Option<String>` on `ChatApp`
  (single-slot since only the selected thread renders); the
  renderer paints a key/value grid between the header chrome and
  the prefill / chat body. Fields: `thread_id`, `pod_id`,
  `created_at`, `last_active`, `backend`, `model`, `max_tokens`,
  `max_turns`, `host_env` (joined names + `cwd:` suffix for
  `HostEnvBinding::Named`), `mcp_hosts`, cumulative usage
  (`total_in` / `total_out`, plus cache r/w when nonzero), and
  `origin behavior` when the thread was spawned by a behavior.
  Hydration is one-shot on `ThreadSnapshot`. Scope rendering,
  the OAuth-aware MCP host detail, and the trigger payload
  pretty-print are deferred — they add substantial surface that
  the v1 inspector doesn't need.

  Bundle scene: `ThreadInspectorOpen`.

  As a side-effect, the chat-scroll body's horizontal padding
  moved from the scroll widget itself onto an inner content
  column with extra right padding (= `tokens::SCROLLBAR_THUMB_WIDTH`),
  so the thumb sits in a reserved gutter when the inspector
  shrinks available height and the body overflows. Lint had
  been flagging this as `ScrollbarObscuresFocusable` once the
  inspector landed; the new wrapper closes the warning across
  all chat-pane scenes.

### Misc

- ⏳ **Pod editor structured tabs.** v1 ships raw-TOML only (a
  single `text_area` sheet). Egui's pod editor has tabs for
  Allow / Defaults / Limits — aetna already has all three
  (`render_pod_editor_*_tab`), so this gap is closed; track here
  only as a note that future surfacing of MCP host CRUD lands
  inside the existing tabs.
- ⏳ **Behavior editor parity.** v1 ships the 80% form (name /
  description / trigger kind / cron schedule / prompt). All
  remaining tabs (Scope, Retention, Thread, System Prompt, Raw
  TOML) have already landed (see Stage 8). Track here only as
  an inventory note.

## Conventions

Picked in this codebase, not enforced by aetna:

- **One file per crate until split is forced.** `app.rs` will eventually
  break into `app/{sidebar, compose, chat_log, modals, wire_handler}.rs`
  the same way the egui sibling does — but only once the line count
  passes ~1500. Premature splitting just hides the architecture.
- **Wire handlers always replace state wholesale where the server is
  authoritative.** `ThreadList` replaces the entire `threads` map. We
  don't merge; the server's view is canonical.
- **Per-thread display state is lazy.** Only threads the user has
  opened get a `ThreadView` entry; long thread lists don't bloat
  memory.
- **Resubscribe on reconnect.** `ConnectionOpened` clears the
  `subscribed` set so re-selecting a thread re-asks for a fresh
  snapshot. The server drops subscriptions on disconnect.
- **Streaming deltas coalesce onto the trailing item.** Mirrors the
  egui sibling. A long generation paints as one growing card, not one
  card per delta.
- **`overlays(main, [])` is the canonical root.** Even when there are
  no current overlay layers, wrapping the root in `overlays(...)`
  reserves the shape for runtime-injected toasts / tooltips / popovers.

## Open questions

- **Bundle dump for streaming states.** The current scenes only cover
  static states. Driving a `ThreadAssistantTextDelta` sequence through
  the dump path is mechanically straightforward but increases
  per-scene seed code. Worth doing once stage 6 lands and tool-call
  rendering becomes complex enough to regression-test visually.
- **Live reload during development.** Aetna doesn't have hot-reload;
  edits to `app.rs` require a recompile + restart. The bundle-dump
  loop fills part of this gap (CPU-only, fast feedback on layout
  intent), but interaction-driven edges (focus traversal, hover
  envelopes, scroll persistence) still require the full window.
- **Picking up upstream aetna changes.** Aetna's API is moving while
  we port. The bundle dump's "no findings" output is the canary —
  when a new version's `lint` flags something we hadn't seen, that's
  the cue to reread the upstream changelog.

## Upstream gaps

Items the aetna sibling needs from upstream before we can close
the gap with the egui webui:

- **`scroll` widget stick-to-bottom mode.** The egui sibling
  uses `egui::ScrollArea::stick_to_bottom(true)` so the chat log
  hugs the most recent turn during streaming. Aetna's `scroll`
  widget exposes only an offset; the App trait can read /
  `set_scroll_offset` on `UiState`, but the App can only see
  `BuildCx { theme }` — the scroll-state setter is host-private,
  so even a "watch the offset and clamp it on each rebuild"
  workaround isn't available from this side. File against
  aetna; once a `pinned_to_end` (or `auto_follow_tail`)
  flag lands, the aetna chat-log scroll picks it up in one
  line.
- ~~**`winit` drag/drop events on `aetna-winit-wgpu`.**~~ Landed
  upstream as `UiEventKind::FileHovered` / `FileHoverCancelled`
  / `FileDropped` (one event per file, path on
  `event.path`); the agent's compose bar consumes the drop arm.
  Clipboard-image paste remains app-side — aetna's
  `text_input.rs` doc explicitly notes "no new aetna API is
  needed": the app intercepts Ctrl+V via `clipboard_request`
  and calls the clipboard backend's `get_image()` (arboard
  native, web-sys on wasm) before falling through to text
  paste.
- **Markdown viewer scroll-from-source.** The aetna-markdown
  body re-builds when the source string grows past a threshold;
  a streaming assistant turn occasionally scrolls flat to the
  top of the body. Probably tied to the stick-to-bottom gap
  above; revisit after that lands.
